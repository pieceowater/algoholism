# Algoholism


## 🔪 Goal: Learn to Solve 90% of Algorithmic Problems

**Focus Areas:**
- Trees / Graphs
- Hash tables / Sliding window / Two pointers
- Backtracking / DFS / BFS
- Dynamic programming / Memoization
- Stack / Queue
- Heap / Sorting / Searching

---

## 🧠 Approach to Any Problem (Thinking Template)

1. **Read the problem** – understand input and output
2. **Visualize:** come up with an example (mentally or on paper)
3. **What’s required?**
    - Minimum/maximum/sum/path/count?
4. **Which data structures fit?**
    - Array, stack, queue, hashmap, tree, graph?
5. **Which technique applies?**
    - Brute-force / greedy / DP / DFS-BFS / two pointers?
6. **What are the edge cases?**
    - Duplicates, cycles, large input?
7. **Start with brute-force, then optimize**

## 📆 30-Day Plan

### 📌 Week 1: Fundamentals + Patterns
- Leetcode: Easy/Medium
- Go through **NeetCode 75** – problems 1–20
- Topics: arrays, hashmaps, two pointers, sliding window
- Learn Go templates for each technique

**Daily:**
- 3 problems: 1 easy, 2 medium
- Daily review: what confused you, how to improve

---

### 📌 Week 2: Trees, DFS, BFS
- Binary tree problems: traversal, search
- Topics: DFS, BFS, recursion, queue, stack

**Daily:**
- 3 problems: 1 tree, 1 graph/search, 1 mixed
- Write down 3 traversal patterns (pre/in/post-order)

---

### 📌 Week 3: DP, Backtracking, Graphs
- Topics: memoization, DP by index, paths, subsets
- Graphs: DFS/BFS, cycles, topological sort, Dijkstra

**Daily:**
- 3 problems: at least 1 DP
    - Speak aloud your thought process and code comments at least once a day

---

### 📌 Week 4: Mock Interviews
- Sites: `pramp.com`, `interviewing.io`
- 45-minute timer per session
- Use Leetcode interview tags (Google, Meta, etc.)

**Daily:**
- 1 full solution under timer
- 2 problem reviews: “What would I do differently?”

## 🧪 Practice Tips

- Use Leetcode (get an account)
- Use [TheAlgorithms/Go](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Go)
- Write everything manually, no autocomplete
- After each problem – ask yourself: “Could I explain this to someone else?”

---

## 📘 Resources

- [Neetcode YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode)
- *Grokking the Coding Interview* (patterns + diagrams)
- [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/) for quick testing
- Create your own “algo-training” repo

---

## 🧠 Senior-Level Framework

1. Don’t solve one problem — learn the problem class
2. Recognize patterns: sliding window, monotonic stack, etc.
3. Ask yourself: which data structure can I apply here?
4. Write clean, readable code + include time complexity
5. Follow idiomatic Go — clean syntax matters

## 💣 Hacks

- Stuck for 10 mins? → peek at the hint, but reimplement yourself
- Say your ideas out loud — even if just to yourself
- Do reverse interviews: take a problem, and create your own interview question from it
